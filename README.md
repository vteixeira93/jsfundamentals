# JavaScript Fundamentals

### Learning how to code

</div>

## A little bit about me
Hello, I have recently decided to learn web development as I have always had a passion for coding. After learning some of the fundamentals of JavaScript I decided to have a go at creating my first very simple program.
</br>

## Aim of my first program:
I've decided to create a program that would have a group of studends from 2 different classes. Each with, obviously, a name and a certain grade.
The program will calcute the average grade for each class, Class A or B, it will then show you a table with data about the studends, their name, grade and if the student was successful.
Finally it will show on the screen the names of the students that had a grade above 10 and congratulate them.

## What I have learned so far:

- Comments &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Variables
- Strings &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Numbers &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Calculations
- Conditionals &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Objects
- Function methods
- Repetition structures &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Booleans
- Organization and structure of code
